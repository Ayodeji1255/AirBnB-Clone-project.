## UI Component Patterns
```

### Component Descriptions
You’ll describe the core UI components you plan to build. Based on the project page, here are the three primary ones:

| Component      | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Navbar**     | Includes logo, search bar, user navigation, and a responsive menu.          |
| **Property Card** | Displays property image, price, location, rating, and a favorite button.   |
| **Footer**     | Contains site links, company info, social media icons, and copyright.       |

Each component should be designed for:
- **Reusability**: Used across multiple pages
- **Consistency**: Matches the design system (colors, typography)
- **Responsiveness**: Works well on mobile and desktop
